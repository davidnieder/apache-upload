About
=====

apache-upload lets users upload files to the webserver.
For each file a random URL is generated which can be shared.
Uploads can either be private and require a valid log-in or be accessible by everyone.
Apache's mod_auth* is used for user authentication.
Uploads and their URLs can expire after some set period.

File upload is handled by flask (python) but serving is done by apache directly
and does not go through the wsgi process which improves performance noticeable.
